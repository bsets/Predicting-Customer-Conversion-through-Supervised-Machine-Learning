# Predicting-Customer-Conversion-through-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Applying Supervised Machine Learning (XGBoost) to predict visitor to customer conversion for an online store

In this project, I have applied XGBoost, a well-known Supervised Learning Algorithm to predict the probability of a visitor to an online store making a purchase (i.e. generating revenue).
