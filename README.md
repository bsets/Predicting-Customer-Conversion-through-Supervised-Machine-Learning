# Predicting-Customer-Conversion-through-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Applying Supervised Machine Learning (XGBoost) to predict visitor to customer conversion for an online store

In this project, I have applied XGBoost, a well-known Supervised Learning Algorithm to predict the probability of a visitor to an online store making a purchase (i.e. generating revenue). 
I did this work as a part of a Data Challenge that I participated in one of the graduate courses in Statistical Learning that I took at the University of Waterloo as a Masters student in Statistics.
I have included the following files in this repository:

online_jewellery_shop_train.xlsx : The original training dataset for the data challenge
online_jewellery_shop_test_final : The original test dataset for the data challenge
Dataset Description.docx : A word document that describes various attributes of the dataset
